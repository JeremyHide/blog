## Experiments:

Ground Truth: For convolution data set, there is a ground truth. For MRF, we assume ground truth will be the solution of CVX

Algorithms:

* Ours: Projected Gradient Descent on Dual Problem
* CVX: directly solving the primal problem
* TFOCS: directly solving the primal problem
* Interior-point: package by S.-J. Kim, K. Koh, M. Lustig, S. Boyd, and D. Gorinevsky
* Coordinate descent: glmnet

Parameter Setting:

### Experiment 1 Results
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/Exp1_signal01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp1_time01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp1_loss01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>

As we can see, our method is much more faster than Interior Point Method and CVX and more accurate(both on positions of support and magnitudes) than all other methods.

<img src="images/Exp1_loss.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>

It seems like TFOS fails to meet the tolerance hence result in no solution for the problem.

This is another run, same conclusion, and for a clearer graph, I plotted only ground truth and the solution of our method.

## Experiments on MRF Data

### Experiment 3 Results
<img src="images/Exp3_signal01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp3_time01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp3_loss01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>

As you can see, our method converged to CVX well and better than all other solutions (interior points and TFOCS all have few more signals than CVX solution), but it is not always the case, so I ran experiment 3 again and get:
<img src="images/Exp3_signal02.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp3_time02.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp3_loss02.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>

This time our solution fails to match the CVX perfectly, but other methods also fails to do that. ( In fact, some times interior points will match all signals solved by CVX but meanwhile the solution will have few more signals than CVX ). Moreover, the time difference between our method and interior points method is not significant even though our method is faster.

To exclude the influence of recovering signal, I also used CVX to solve the dual and set the same recovering algorithm to compare our method and CVX. 
<img src="images/Exp4_signal01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp4_time01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp4_loss01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>
<img src="images/Exp4_cleared_signal01.jpg" style="width: 800px"/>

As we can see, it takes long time for CVX to solve the dual problem, the signal recovered from sloving dual by CVX and our method matched. However, they all cannot match the primal problem solution. So the problem now is whether CVX primal problem solution can really be the ground truth? 

## Things Found:

* Our method can be speed up by finding an appropriate initialization (\\(x_0\\) and initial stepsize). 
* Interior-point method is much more faster on MRF Data than on Conv Data.
* Recovering signal becomes tougher on MRF Data
* CVX Solve dual slower than solve primal 
* Does CVX primal problem solution can really be the ground truth?
